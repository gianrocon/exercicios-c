/*
The conditional expression often leads to succinct code. For example, this loop prints n elements of an array, 10 per line, with each column separated by one blank, and with each line (including the last) terminated by a newline.
A newline is printed after every tenth element, and after the n-th. All other elements are followed by one blank. This might look tricky, but itâ€™s more compact than the equivalent if-else.
